# This script emulates the behavior of schroot, which:
# - Invokes chroot(2) as root (schroot is setuid).
# - setuids back to the uid it was run as.
# - chdirs to the directory it was run from.
# - execs the command supplied as arguments, or starts an interactive shell.
#
# Trying to write a single command that can be passed to sudo that will do the
# su, chdir, exec combination without breaking arg tokenisation is nigh
# impossible. Instead, once the chrooting and setuiding (via sudo) has been
# taken care of, the script execs itself with --chroot_done. This takes care
# of the chdir and exec.
